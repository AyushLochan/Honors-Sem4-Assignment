console.log(2^4);
// The output of the statement 'console. log(2 ^ 4) ; ' is '6'.

// This might be surprising at first, as one might expect the result to be '16', since '2' raised to the
// power of '4' equals '16'. However, the "^ operator in JavaScript is not a power operator, but
// rather the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.

// Here's how it works:

// . '2' in binary is '10'.
// . '4' in binary is '100'.
